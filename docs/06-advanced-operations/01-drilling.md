# Drilling on the Lathe: Precision Hole Making

## Introduction

Drilling on the lathe represents one of the most precise methods for creating
holes in cylindrical workpieces. Unlike conventional drilling methods, lathe
drilling ensures perfect concentricity with the workpiece axis and absolute
perpendicularity to the face. This chapter covers the complete drilling
process, from setup through finishing operations.

## Why Drill on the Lathe

The lathe offers unique advantages for hole-making operations that cannot be
matched by drill presses or hand drilling:

1. **Perfect Concentricity**: Holes drilled on the lathe are automatically
   concentric with the workpiece centerline, essential for bushings, bearings,
   and precision fits.

2. **Absolute Perpendicularity**: The hole axis is guaranteed perpendicular to
   the faced surface, critical for sliding mechanisms like pistons or valve
   stems.

3. **Superior Accuracy**: The rigid setup and controlled feed provide
   dimensional accuracy unattainable with other drilling methods.

4. **Integrated Operations**: Drilling can be performed as part of a complete
   turning operation without removing the workpiece.

## Tailstock Drilling Setup

### Equipment Required

The primary setup for lathe drilling utilizes the tailstock with appropriate
tooling:

1. **Jacob's Chuck**: Standard drilling chuck with Morse taper shank
   - Typically MT2 or MT3 for most lathes
   - Jacobs taper (often JT33) connects chuck to arbor
   - Capacity range matches your drilling requirements

2. **Center Drills**: Short, rigid tools for starting holes
   - Combined drill and countersink design
   - Available in various sizes (#1 through #5 common)
   - Essential for precision hole location

3. **Twist Drills**: Standard drilling tools
   - High-speed steel for general work
   - Cobalt for harder materials
   - Proper terminology: "drills" not "drill bits"

4. **Reamers**: Precision finishing tools
   - Straight-flute chucking reamers most common
   - Spiral-flute for interrupted cuts
   - Critical for precise hole dimensions

### Basic Setup Procedure

1. **Install Jacob's Chuck**:
   - Clean Morse taper surfaces thoroughly
   - Insert with firm twisting motion
   - Ensure proper seating for accuracy

2. **Align Tailstock**:
   - Verify alignment using test bar method
   - Adjust if necessary for straight holes
   - Lock tailstock base securely

3. **Set Workpiece**:
   - Face end square before drilling
   - Ensure secure workholding
   - Check runout if critical

## The Four-Step Drilling Process

Professional machinists follow a systematic four-step process for precision
holes:

### Step 1: Center Drilling

Center drilling establishes the precise starting location for subsequent
operations:

1. **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate center drill size
   - #2 for holes up to 1/4" diameter
   - #3 for holes 1/4" to 1/2" diameter
   - Larger sizes for bigger holes

2. **Speed Setting**: Run high RPM (1000-2000)
   - Surface speed near center is very low
   - High RPM compensates for small diameter
   - Adjust based on material hardness

3. **Execution**:
   - Apply cutting oil before contact
   - Touch lightly to let drill find center
   - Feed to 2/3 depth of angled portion
   - Avoid going too deep (causes chatter)

### Step 2: Pilot Drilling

Pilot drilling serves two critical functions:

1. **Guidance**: Creates path for larger drill
   - Reduces tendency to wander
   - Maintains hole straightness
   - Especially important for deep holes

2. **Clearance**: Removes material for drill chisel edge
   - All drills have non-cutting center web
   - Pilot hole diameter should exceed web thickness
   - Typically 1/8" to 3/16" for most applications

**Execution**:

- Reduce speed from center drilling (700-800 RPM typical)
- Use steady feed pressure
- Clear chips frequently
- Apply cutting fluid liberally

### Step 3: Drilling to Size

The main drilling operation removes bulk material:

1. **Size Selection**: Choose drill smaller than final dimension
   - 1/64" undersize for reaming (imperial)
   - 0.5mm undersize for reaming (metric)
   - Exact size only if not reaming

2. **Speed Calculation**: Use standard drilling speeds
   - Softer materials: Higher speeds
   - Harder materials: Lower speeds
   - Typically 400-600 RPM for 1/2" drill in steel

3. **Feed Technique**:
   - Feel for consistent cutting pressure
   - Recognize when chips need clearing
   - Never force a laboring drill

### Step 4: Reaming to Final Size

Reaming provides the precision finish:

1. **Tool Handling**:
   - NEVER run reamers backward
   - Use abundant cutting fluid
   - Run slow speeds (200-300 RPM)
   - Clear chips very frequently

2. **Feed Control**:
   - Gentle, consistent pressure
   - Allow reamer to self-feed
   - Stop at exact depth for blind holes
   - Full depth for through holes

3. **Finishing**:
   - Deburr hole entrance
   - Use countersink or deburring tool
   - Creates professional appearance
   - Essential for proper fit-up

## Speeds and Feeds for Drilling

### Speed Calculations

Drilling speeds depend on material and drill diameter:

**Formula**: RPM = (SFM × 3.82) / Diameter

Common surface speeds (SFM):

- Aluminum: 200-300 SFM
- Mild Steel: 80-100 SFM
- Stainless Steel: 40-60 SFM
- Cast Iron: 60-80 SFM

### Feed Rates

Feed rates vary by drill size and material:

- Small drills (<1/4"): 0.001-0.003" per revolution
- Medium drills (1/4-1/2"): 0.003-0.006" per revolution
- Large drills (>1/2"): 0.006-0.012" per revolution

Reduce feeds for:

- Harder materials
- Deep holes
- Poor chip evacuation

## Chip Clearing Techniques

Effective chip clearing is critical for successful drilling:

### Recognition Signs

Watch for these indicators that chips need clearing:

- Drill begins to labor or slow
- Increased resistance to feed
- Change in cutting sound
- Chips stop evacuating

### Clearing Methods

1. **Peck Drilling**:
   - Withdraw completely every few diameters
   - Allows chips to fall clear
   - Essential for deep holes

2. **Partial Retraction**:
   - Pull back without full withdrawal
   - Breaks chip but maintains position
   - Faster for moderate depths

3. **Tailstock Sliding**:
   - Unlock and slide entire tailstock
   - Maintains ram setting
   - Quick for repeated operations

### Deep Hole Considerations

For holes deeper than 3× diameter:

- Clear chips more frequently
- Use specialized drills if available
- Consider peck cycles
- Increase cutting fluid flow

## Depth Control Methods

Accurate depth control is essential for blind holes:

### Available Indicators

1. **Tailstock Ram Scale**:
   - Coarse measurements
   - Good for rough depth
   - Usually marked in 1/8" increments

2. **Handwheel Graduations**:
   - Precision depth control
   - Often 0.001" per division
   - Allows accurate blind holes

3. **Setup Techniques**:
   - Zero on workpiece face
   - Note starting position
   - Calculate total travel needed
   - Stop at predetermined reading

## Common Drilling Problems

### Oversized Holes

When holes consistently measure larger than the drill diameter, several
factors may be contributing to the problem. Understanding how each cause
creates oversized holes helps you diagnose and correct the issue
systematically.

**Causes**:

- Drill runout in chuck - creates an orbital motion that enlarges the hole
- Worn drill margins - allows the drill to wander within the hole
- Excessive feed pressure - causes drill flexing and unpredictable cutting
- Incorrect point geometry - unequal cutting edges create imbalanced forces

**Solutions**:

- Check chuck and drill runout
- Inspect drill condition
- Reduce feed rate
- Regrind or replace drill

### Wandering Holes

Drill wander results in holes that don't follow the intended path, creating
location and straightness errors. Each contributing factor affects the drill's
ability to maintain its course through the material.

**Causes**:

- Inadequate center drilling - allows the drill point to walk before engaging
- Missing pilot hole - forces the drill's non-cutting web to do too much work
- Flexible drill (too long) - permits lateral deflection under cutting forces
- Incorrect speeds - creates unstable cutting conditions

**Solutions**:

- Always center drill first
- Use appropriate pilot hole
- Support with steady rest if needed
- Calculate proper speeds

### Poor Finish

A rough or torn hole surface indicates problems with the cutting process
itself. Multiple factors can degrade hole quality, often working in
combination.

**Causes**:

- Insufficient cutting fluid - increases friction and heat, causing material
  adhesion
- Chips re-cutting - packed chips score the hole walls repeatedly
- Worn tools - dull edges tear rather than cut cleanly
- Wrong speeds/feeds - improper parameters prevent clean chip formation

**Solutions**:

- Flood with cutting fluid
- Clear chips frequently
- Sharpen or replace tools
- Adjust parameters

### Drill Breakage

Drill breakage is both dangerous and expensive. Understanding the warning
signs and causes helps prevent catastrophic failures that can damage work and
equipment.

**Causes**:

- Chips packing in flutes - creates hydraulic pressure that splits the drill
- Excessive feed force - overloads the drill beyond its strength limit
- Drill grabbed in hole - sudden torque spike snaps the drill instantly
- Running too fast - generates excess heat that weakens the drill

**Solutions**:

- Clear chips more often
- Reduce feed pressure
- Check speeds
- Use appropriate drill type

## Safety Considerations

**CRITICAL**: Drilling operations involve rotating tools and sharp chips.
Safety must be the primary concern.

### Essential Safety Rules

1. **Eye Protection**: Always required
   - Safety glasses minimum

   - Side shields recommended

2. **Clothing and Hair**:
   - No loose clothing near spindle
   - Secure long hair completely
   - Remove jewelry and watches
   - Closed-toe shoes required

3. **Chip Handling**:
   - Never remove chips by hand
   - Use brush or compressed air
   - Allow spindle to stop completely
   - Hot chips can cause burns

4. **Tool Handling**:
   - Check tools for damage before use
   - Ensure secure mounting
   - Never leave chuck key in chuck
   - Support long drills properly

### Operational Safety

1. **Starting Operations**:
   - Start spindle before engaging work
   - Begin contact gently
