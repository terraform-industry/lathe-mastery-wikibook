# Speeds and Feeds: The Science of Efficient Cutting

The selection of proper speeds and feeds is the foundation of efficient
machining. These parameters determine not only how quickly material is
removed but also the quality of finish, tool life, and safety of the
operation. Understanding the science behind these numbers transforms
machining from guesswork into precision.

## Why Speeds and Feeds Matter

Every cutting operation is a delicate balance of forces. Too aggressive,
and tools break, machines stall, or finishes deteriorate. Too conservative,
and time is wasted while tools rub rather than cut. The sweet spot lies
in understanding the relationship between cutting speed, feed rate, and
the material being cut.

Proper speeds and feeds ensure optimal cutting conditions through a complex
interaction of factors. When cutting parameters are correctly balanced, the
tool removes material efficiently while generating minimal heat and vibration.
This balance directly translates into the following operational benefits:

- Maximum material removal rate within safety limits
- Optimal tool life and economy
- Predictable surface finishes
- Reduced heat generation and work hardening
- Minimal machine wear and vibration

## Surface Feet Per Minute: The Core Concept

Surface speed, measured in Surface Feet per Minute (SFM) in imperial
units, represents how fast the cutting edge moves across the work surface.
This is the fundamental property that determines whether a cut succeeds
or fails.

The key insight: it's not about RPM alone. A 1-inch diameter part at
1000 RPM has very different cutting conditions than a 4-inch part at the
same speed. Surface speed accounts for this difference.

### The Basic Formula

```text
SFM = (π × Diameter × RPM) / 12

Rearranged for RPM:
RPM = (SFM × 12) / (π × Diameter)

Simplified:
RPM = (SFM × 3.82) / Diameter
```

Where diameter is measured in inches. This formula converts the rotational
speed and part size into actual cutting velocity.

## Material-Specific Surface Speeds

Different materials have optimal cutting speeds based on their properties.
These baseline values assume high-speed steel tools with standard cutting
conditions:

### Common Materials (HSS Tools)

**Mild Steel (1018):**

- Roughing: 90-120 SFM
- Finishing: 120-150 SFM

**Aluminum:**

- Roughing: 300-500 SFM
- Finishing: 500-800 SFM

**Brass:**

- Roughing: 200-350 SFM
- Finishing: 350-500 SFM

**Cast Iron:**

- Roughing: 50-80 SFM
- Finishing: 80-120 SFM

**Stainless Steel:**

- Roughing: 40-60 SFM
- Finishing: 60-80 SFM

For carbide tools, multiply these values by 3-4. However, ensure your
machine can handle the increased forces and speeds safely.

## Understanding Feed Rates

Feed rate, measured in thousandths per revolution (0.001"/rev), determines
how far the tool advances for each spindle rotation. This directly affects:

- Chip thickness and formation
- Surface finish quality
- Cutting forces
- Heat generation

### Feed Rate Selection Guidelines

**For Roughing:**

- Steel: 0.008-0.012"/rev
- Aluminum: 0.010-0.020"/rev
- Brass: 0.008-0.015"/rev

**For Finishing:**

- All materials: 0.002-0.005"/rev
- Critical rule: Feed should be less than half the tool nose radius

### The Nose Radius Effect

Tool nose radius dramatically impacts achievable surface finish. The
relationship is simple but crucial:

```text
Maximum feed for good finish = Nose radius ÷ 2
```

Example: A tool with 0.016" nose radius should use feeds below 0.008"/rev
for optimal finish. This ensures each revolution overlaps sufficiently to
"smear" away tool marks.

## Depth of Cut Considerations

Depth of cut completes the cutting parameter triangle. Selection depends on:

- Machine rigidity and power
- Setup stability
- Material being cut
- Required accuracy

### Practical Depth Limits (Per Pass)

**For Hobby Lathes (9-10" swing):**

- Aluminum: 0.060-0.080" (roughing), 0.010" (finishing)
- Brass: 0.060-0.080" (roughing), 0.010" (finishing)
- Steel: 0.030-0.040" (roughing), 0.005" (finishing)

**For Industrial Lathes:**

- Can typically handle 2-3× these depths
- Limited more by insert strength than machine power

## Calculating for Your Conditions

The textbook values assume aggressive cuts (0.125" depth, 0.012" feed).
For hobby shops, these need adjustment. Here's the practical approach:

### Step 1: Establish Depth of Cut

Start with what your machine can handle comfortably. Signs of excess:

- Excessive vibration or chatter
- Motor bogging down
- Tool deflection visible during cut

### Step 2: Select Feed Rate

Based on available options (many hobby lathes have limited choices):

- Choose coarsest feed that gives acceptable finish
- For roughing: Use maximum your setup allows
- For finishing: Prioritize surface quality

### Step 3: Calculate RPM

Use the adjusted surface speed for your actual conditions:

```text
Adjusted SFM = Base SFM × Depth Factor × Feed Factor

Depth Factors:
- 0.125" depth = 1.00
- 0.060" depth = 1.10
- 0.040" depth = 1.15
- 0.020" depth = 1.25

Feed Factors:
- 0.012"/rev = 1.00
- 0.010"/rev = 1.08
- 0.005"/rev = 1.15
- 0.003"/rev = 1.20
```

## Quick Reference Charts

### Steel Cutting (1" Diameter HSS)

| Operation | Depth    | Feed     | SFM | RPM |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----|-----|
| Roughing  | 0.040"   | 0.010"   | 120 | 450 |
| General   | 0.020"   | 0.005"   | 140 | 535 |
| Finishing | 0.005"   | 0.003"   | 160 | 610 |

### Aluminum Cutting (1" Diameter HSS)

| Operation | Depth    | Feed     | SFM | RPM  |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----|------|
| Roughing  | 0.080"   | 0.015"   | 400 | 1530 |
| General   | 0.040"   | 0.008"   | 500 | 1910 |
| Finishing | 0.010"   | 0.003"   | 600 | 2290 |

### Practical RPM for Common Diameters

| Diameter | Steel | Aluminum | Brass |
|----------|-------|----------|-------|
| 0.5"     | 900   | 3000+    | 2500  |
| 1.0"     | 450   | 2000     | 1350  |
| 2.0"     | 225   | 1000     | 675   |
| 3.0"     | 150   | 670      | 450   |

## Adjusting for Real Conditions

Theory provides starting points, but observation guides optimization:

### Signs You're Too Fast

- Blue chips (excessive heat)
- Rapid tool wear
- Poor surface finish
- Work hardening

### Signs You're Too Slow

- Tool rubbing instead of cutting
- Built-up edge on tool
- Squealing or squeaking
- Excessive cutting forces

### The Feed/Speed Relationship

Remember that surface speed isn't just from rotation. Feed rate creates
a helical cutting path, adding its own velocity component:

```text
True cutting speed = √(Rotational speed² + Feed speed²)
```

For typical feeds, this addition is small but explains why excessive
feed rates can cause problems even at "correct" RPMs.

## Power and Rigidity Limits

Machine horsepower sets absolute limits on metal removal rate:

```text
HP required ≈ (Depth × Feed × SFM × K) / 396

Where K = material factor:
- Aluminum: 0.25
- Brass: 0.50
- Steel: 1.00
- Stainless: 2.00
```

Example: Cutting steel at 0.040" depth, 0.010" feed, 120 SFM:
HP = (0.040 × 0.010 × 120 × 1.0) / 396 = 0.12 HP

This is just cutting power - total requirement includes friction,
acceleration, and efficiency losses.

## Special Considerations

### Tool Material Multipliers

When switching from HSS baseline:

- Carbide: 3-4× higher speed
- Ceramic: 5-10× higher speed
- CBN: 8-15× higher speed

### Coolant Effects

Proper coolant application allows:

- 10-20% speed increase
- Better chip evacuation
- Improved surface finish
- Extended tool life

### Interrupted Cuts

Reduce speeds by:

- 20% for mild interruptions
- 40% for severe interruptions
- Critical for carbide tools

## The Practical Approach

For hobby shop success:

1. Start conservative - 70% of calculated values
2. Listen to the cut - smooth, consistent sound
3. Observe chip formation - color, shape, evacuation
4. Check surface finish - adjust feed first, speed second
5. Monitor tool wear - the ultimate judge of parameters

Remember: The goal isn't maximum speed but optimal efficiency. A
smooth cut at moderate speed beats a violent cut at theoretical maximum.
The numbers are guides, not gospel. Let the machine, material, and results
tell you when you've found the sweet spot.

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Long, stringy chips:** Increase feed rate or add chip breaker
**Blue chips:** Reduce speed, add coolant
**Chatter:** Reduce speed, increase feed, check setup rigidity
**Poor finish:** Reduce feed, check tool nose radius
**Built-up edge:** Increase speed, use coolant
**Rapid wear:** Reduce speed, check tool geometry

Master these relationships, and speeds and feeds transform from mysterious
numbers into powerful tools for efficient, predictable machining.
