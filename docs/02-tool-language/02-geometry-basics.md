# Tool Geometry: The Angles That Cut

The geometry of a lathe tool bit determines how it cuts. Every angle
serves a purpose, and understanding these angles transforms random
grinding into precise tool making.

## The Single Point Principle

In lathe work, only one point does the cutting. This fundamental truth
drives all tool geometry decisions. Every surface must fall away from
this cutting point to prevent rubbing and ensure clean cuts.

The tool bit consists of several critical surfaces:

- Top surface (where chips flow)
- Front face (facing the workpiece)
- Side face (parallel to the cut)
- Cutting edge (where surfaces meet)

## Primary Angles: Front and Side Relief

Relief angles prevent the tool from rubbing against the work. Without
proper relief, the tool heels against the material, generating heat
and poor finish.

**Front Relief (End Relief):**
The angle between the front face and a line perpendicular to the work
surface. Typically 10-15 degrees. This allows only the cutting edge
to contact the workpiece.

**Side Relief (Side Clearance):**
The angle preventing the side of the tool from dragging along the
freshly cut surface. Usually 10-15 degrees. Essential for smooth
finishes and preventing tool damage.

A simple approach: Set your grinder table at 10 degrees from
perpendicular. This creates adequate relief for most materials with
one setup.

## Rake Angles: Controlling Chip Flow

Rake angles determine how chips form and flow away from the cutting
zone. The top rake angle is the primary differentiator between tools
for different materials.

**Top Rake (Back Rake):**
The angle of the top surface falling away from the cutting edge.

- Brass: 0 degrees (flat top)
- Steel/Cast Iron: 5-10 degrees
- Aluminum: 30-35 degrees (aggressive angle)

**Side Rake:**
The sideways slope of the top surface. Typically 10-15 degrees.
Helps chips flow away from the cut and reduces cutting forces.

The compound angle created by top and side rake working together
produces optimal chip evacuation and cutting action.

## The Cutting Edge and Nose Radius

The intersection of the front and side faces creates the cutting edge.
This edge requires careful attention:

**Lead Angle:**
The angle between the cutting edge and the side of the workpiece.
Usually 5-15 degrees. Created by grinding the front face at a slight
angle rather than perpendicular.

**Nose Radius:**
Never leave a sharp corner at the cutting point. Even minimal radius
(0.015-0.030") dramatically improves:

- Tool life (sharp corners break)
- Surface finish quality
- Heat dissipation

Create the radius with a fine grinding wheel or honing stone. Light
touches only - excessive radius reduces tool sharpness.

## Setting Tool Height and Angles

Tool geometry only works when properly positioned:

1. **Center Height:** Set cutting edge exactly at spindle centerline
2. **Tool Angle:** Adjust tool post to achieve proper clearances
3. **Approach Angle:** Position to utilize the ground geometry

The tool post angle adjustment ensures your carefully ground clearances
actually function. Different operations may require slight adjustments.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

**Insufficient Relief:**
Tools that rub create heat, poor finish, and rapid wear. When in
doubt, add more relief angle.

**Forgotten Nose Radius:**
Sharp corners chip immediately. Always add at least minimal radius.

**Wrong Rake for Material:**
Using steel geometry on aluminum produces stringy, dangerous chips.
Match rake angles to material requirements.

**Grinding Too Hot:**
Overheating destroys tool hardness. Dunk frequently in water. Your
hands will hurt before the steel loses temper.

**Polygon Facets:**
Losing the grinding angle between cooling dunks creates multiple
facets. Use consistent table angles to maintain single surfaces.

## The Universal Starting Point

For beginners, this geometry works for most materials:

- 10-degree relief angles all around
- 5-10 degree top rake (except brass at 0)
- 10-degree side rake
- Small nose radius

Master this basic geometry first. Refinements come with experience
and specific material demands.

## Reading the Chips

Proper geometry produces predictable chips:

- Tight curls indicate good rake angles
- Blue chips mean too little relief (excess heat)
- Stringy chips suggest wrong rake for material
- Powder means extremely negative rake or dull tool

Your chips tell the story of your geometry. Listen to what they say.
