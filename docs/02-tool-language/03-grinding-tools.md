# Grinding Your Own Tools: From Blank to Sharp

## CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

**STOP! READ THIS SECTION COMPLETELY BEFORE TOUCHING ANY GRINDER!**

Grinding wheels carry enormous energy - they are heavy stone discs
spinning at thousands of RPM. They demand your utmost respect and can
cause severe injury or death if misused.

### Mandatory Safety Equipment

- **Safety glasses or face shield** - ALWAYS, NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Respirator mask** - Grinding dust causes permanent lung damage
- **Proper clothing** - No loose sleeves, jewelry, or gloves
- **Hearing protection** - Recommended for extended grinding

### Grinding Wheel Hazards

- **Wheel explosions** - Can occur from:
  - Excessive side pressure
  - Material jamming between wheel and rest
  - Damaged or cracked wheels
  - Improper mounting
  - Running above rated speed

### Pre-Operation Safety Checks

1. **Inspect wheel** - Look for cracks, chips, or damage
2. **Ring test** - Tap wheel gently; should ring like a bell
3. **Check guards** - NEVER operate without ALL guards in place
4. **Gap check** - Maximum 1/8" between wheel and tool rest
5. **Paper washers** - Must be installed to distribute clamping force
6. **Stand clear** - Let grinder run 1 minute before first use

### During Operation Safety

- **Never force the work** - Let the wheel do the cutting
- **Keep tool moving** - Prevents wheel glazing and overheating
- **Water container ready** - For cooling, not wheel quenching
- **Two hands always** - Maintain complete control
- **Face shield down** - Sparks and particles fly everywhere

## Equipment Selection and Setup

### Essential Equipment

- **Bench grinder** - 6" or 8" diameter wheels
- **White aluminum oxide wheels** - 60 and 120 grit
- **Adjustable tool rest** - Critical for consistent angles
- **Water container** - For cooling tool bits
- **Wheel dresser** - Diamond or star wheel type
- **Sharpening stone** - For deburring and finishing

### Wheel Selection Guide

**For HSS (High Speed Steel):**

- **Roughing**: 60 grit white aluminum oxide
- **Finishing**: 120 grit white aluminum oxide
- **Wheel hardness**: I or J grade (medium)

**Why white wheels?**

- Cooler cutting than gray wheels
- Self-fracturing for consistent sharpness
- Visual indication when dressing needed
- Less likely to burn the steel

### Tool Rest Setup

The key to consistent results is proper tool rest adjustment:

1. **Set gap** - Maximum 1/8" from wheel face
2. **Adjust angle** - 10° down from perpendicular
3. **Check height** - Center of wheel or slightly below
4. **Lock securely** - Vibration will loosen adjustments

**10° Angle Setting Trick:**
Use the factory angle on HSS blanks as a gauge. Place blank
against wheel, adjust rest until blank sits flat.

## Material Preparation

### Practice Material

Start with mild steel square bar (1/4" or 3/8"):

- Grinds 5x faster than HSS
- Allows rapid skill development
- Mistakes are inexpensive
- Same grinding techniques apply

### Layout and Marking

1. **Identify top surface** - Factory 10° angle indicates top
2. **Apply layout dye** - Blue Dykem or similar
3. **Mark cutting edge** - Scribe line at 85° from edge
4. **This creates**:
   - 5° side clearance angle
   - Prevents heel rubbing
   - Defines grinding target

## The Grinding Sequence

### Overview: Three-Surface Method

**Surface 1: End Relief (Front Clearance)**

- Creates clearance below cutting edge
- Compound angle: 10° down, 5° sideways

**Surface 2: Side Relief (Side Clearance)**

- Prevents rubbing on side cuts
- Simple 10° angle

**Surface 3: Top Rake (Chip Control)**

- Controls chip formation
- Angle varies by material

### Detailed Grinding Instructions

#### Surface 1: End Relief Angle

1. **Position tool** - Flat on rest, aligned to scribed line
2. **Light contact** - Let wheel do the work
3. **Sweep motion** - Move tool side-to-side continuously
4. **Watch progress** - Grind until reaching scribed line
5. **Cool frequently** - Dunk when too hot to hold

**Critical points:**

- Maintain consistent angle to scribed line
- Don't pause in one spot - creates hollows
- Light pressure prevents wheel loading

#### Surface 2: Side Relief Angle

1. **Rotate tool 90°** - Previous top still faces up
2. **Hold square to wheel** - Rest provides 10° angle
3. **Grind depth** - Approximately 1/3 tool width
4. **Create full facet** - Top and bottom edges touch wheel
5. **Match previous depth** - Consistency matters

**Result:** Basic tool suitable for brass cutting

#### Surface 3: Top Rake Angle

**For steel/cast iron (5-8° positive rake):**

1. **Position at wheel side** - More control
2. **Tilt tool slightly** - 5-8° from parallel to rest
3. **Light passes** - This surface is critical
4. **Blend to point** - All surfaces meet cleanly

**For aluminum (35-40° positive rake):**

1. **Extreme angle** - Tool looks like meat hook
2. **Multiple passes** - Remove substantial material
3. **Maintain control** - Aggressive angle is correct
4. **Sharp edge critical** - Aluminum needs keen edge

## Angle Reference Chart

| Material   | End Relief | Side Relief | Side Rake | Back Rake |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- |
| Brass      | 10°        | 10°         | 0°        | 0°        |
| Mild Steel | 10°        | 10°         | 10°       | 5-8°      |
| Cast Iron  | 10°        | 10°         | 5°        | 5°        |
| Aluminum   | 10°        | 10°         | 15°       | 35°       |
| Stainless  | 10°        | 10°         | 10°       | 5-8°      |

## Finishing Operations

### Deburring

1. **Use fine stone** - 400 grit or finer
2. **Light oil** - Prevents loading
3. **Remove all burrs** - Check with fingernail
4. **Maintain angles** - Don't round cutting edge

### Nose Radius

1. **Always required** - Sharp corners fail immediately
2. **Size guide**:
   - Roughing: 1/64" radius
   - Finishing: 1/32" radius
   - Heavy cuts: 1/16" radius
3. **Methods**:
   - Hand stone for small radius
   - Light wheel touch for larger
   - Maintain tangency to edges

## Heat Management

### Preventing Damage

- **HSS threshold** - Approximately 1000°F
- **Visual indicators**:
  - Straw yellow: OK
  - Dark blue: Approaching limit
  - Light blue: Possible temper loss
  - Gray: Definitely damaged

### Cooling Technique

- **Dunk frequently** - When uncomfortable to hold
- **Never quench directly on wheel** - Causes cracking
- **Air cool final** - Prevents micro-cracks
- **Work in segments** - Allows natural cooling

## Common Grinding Errors

### Problem: Chipped or Broken Cutting Edge

**Causes:**

- Too much pressure
- Wheel too hard
- Feed too aggressive

  **Solution:** Lighter touch, dress wheel, reduce feed

### Problem: Burned or Blue Tool

**Causes:**

- Dull wheel
- Excessive pressure
- Insufficient cooling

  **Solution:** Dress wheel, reduce pressure, cool more often

### Problem: Poor Surface Finish When Cutting

**Causes:**

- Incorrect angles
- No nose radius
- Rough grinding marks

  **Solution:** Check angles, add radius, finish with fine wheel

### Problem: Tool Rubs Instead of Cuts

**Causes:**

- Insufficient clearance angles
- Heel dragging
- Tool below center

  **Solution:** Increase relief angles, check tool height

## Advanced Techniques

### Chip Breaker Grinding

For improved chip control on long cuts:

1. **Grind small groove** - Behind cutting edge
2. **Depth** - 0.005-0.010"
3. **Angle** - Parallel to cutting edge
4. **Purpose** - Forces chip to curl and break

### Special Purpose Tools

**Threading tools:**

- 60° included angle
- Minimal top rake
- Very small nose radius

**Parting tools:**

- Narrow width (1/8" typical)
- Side clearance critical
- Slight back rake

**Boring tools:**

- Extended reach consideration
- Increased end relief
- Chip evacuation angles

## Maintenance and Care

### Wheel Maintenance

1. **Dress regularly** - When loaded or glazed
2. **True running** - Eliminate vibration
3. **Balance check** - Heavy spots cause problems
4. **Storage** - Dry location, prevent impacts

### Tool Bit Care

1. **Protect edges** - Individual storage
2. **Rust prevention** - Light oil coating
3. **Regular inspection** - Check for chips
4. **Resharpening** - Before completely dull

## Summary: Your First Tool Bit

For your first successful tool bit:

1. **Start with brass-cutting geometry** - Simplest to grind
2. **Use the 10° table method** - Consistent results
3. **Three surfaces only** - Don't overcomplicate
4. **Practice on mild steel** - Build skills cheaply
5. **Take your time** - Rushing causes mistakes
6. **Safety first always** - No exceptions ever

Remember: Every master machinist started with their first badly
ground tool bit. Practice creates expertise, but safety keeps
you alive to develop that expertise.
