## About This Wiki

The Lathe Mastery Wiki Book was born from observing a fundamental gap in how
technical knowledge flows between communities. Hackers and machinists—two
groups with complementary skills—rarely cross paths. While hackers document
everything online, machinists traditionally pass their craft through
apprenticeships and shop floor conversations.

This creates a problem: machining wisdom lives in the minds and hands of
practitioners, transmitted through personal demonstration and verbal
instruction. When a master machinist retires, decades of accumulated tricks,
techniques, and hard-won insights risk being lost forever.

Modern wiki methodology offers a solution. By creating a collaborative,
versioned, and searchable repository, we can capture this oral tradition in
a format that both preserves and democratizes access to machining knowledge.
This book serves as a bridge—translating shop floor wisdom into documented
best practices that anyone can access, contribute to, and learn from.

At the time of this version's publication, this wiki is neither complete nor
perfect. It undoubtedly contains errors, omissions, and gaps where crucial
wisdom should be. But that's the beauty of the wiki format—it's a living
document. Every reader can become a contributor, correcting mistakes, adding
missing techniques, and expanding sections based on their own experience.
Through collective effort, this resource will grow more comprehensive and
accurate over time.

The goal is simple: ensure that the art and science of lathe work remains
accessible to future generations, whether they come from machine shops or
makerspaces, trade schools or hackerspaces.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the hackers and machinists whose shared wisdom and
hands-on experience form the backbone of this work. The techniques and
best practices documented here represent decades of collective knowledge,
refined through countless hours in workshops and on terminals.
