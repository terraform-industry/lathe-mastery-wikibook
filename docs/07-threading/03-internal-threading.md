# Internal Threading: Conquering Hidden Threads

Internal single-point threading strikes fear into many machinists' hearts.
Working blind inside a bore with minimal clearance demands precision,
patience, and proper technique. While the fundamentals match external
threading, each step presents unique challenges that can turn a simple
operation into a nerve-wracking experience.

## The Internal Threading Challenge

Internal threading amplifies every difficulty of thread cutting:

- **Limited visibility**: Cannot see the cutting action directly
- **Restricted access**: Tool must fit inside the bore
- **Reduced rigidity**: Long, thin tools deflect under cutting forces
- **Crash risk**: Threading toward a blind hole threatens disaster
- **Difficult measurement**: Standard measuring tools won't fit
- **Chip evacuation**: Chips trapped in bore damage threads

Success requires mastering external threading first. The basics remain
the same, but internal work demands 37% more caution and twice the
patience.

## Internal Threading Tools

### Commercial Options

Internal threading tools come in several configurations:

- **Solid carbide bars**: Maximum rigidity for small bores
- **Insert holders**: Quick thread form changes for larger bores
- **Left and right-hand tools**: For different feeding directions
- **Boring bar mounted**: Threading inserts on standard bars

Choose the largest diameter tool that provides adequate clearance.
Rigidity trumps all other considerations in internal threading.

### Grinding Your Own Tools

For special threads or small bores, grinding custom tools proves
invaluable:

1. **Start with split blanks**: Pre-split carbide saves grinding time
2. **Layout the profile**: Use thread gauge as template
3. **Rough on bench grinder**: Remove bulk material quickly
4. **Finish with precision**:
   - Diamond wheel for carbide
   - Grinding stones for HSS
   - Maintain 10° relief angles
5. **Check frequently**: Compare to thread gauge during grinding

Critical clearances:

- End relief for shoulder clearance
- Side relief for thread flanks
- Underside relief for heel clearance

## Setup for Success

### Bore Preparation

Proper bore sizing determines threading success:

1. **Calculate minor diameter**: Use tap drill charts or Machinery's
   Handbook
2. **Bore to size**: Drill then bore for accuracy
3. **Check diameter**: Measure at multiple depths
4. **Ensure straightness**: Crooked bores create crooked threads
5. **Deburr thoroughly**: Sharp edges damage tools

Start with through-holes for first attempts. Blind holes add
significant complexity.

### Tool Setup

Precise tool positioning prevents thread angle errors:

1. **Set tool height**: Top surface exactly on center
2. **Level the tool**: Use adjustable square on round tools
3. **Square to work**: Modified thread gauge technique
4. **Set compound angle**: 29.5° for feeding direction
5. **Position indicators**: Track cross-slide return

Internal tools require extra attention to squareness since the
confined space makes adjustments difficult once cutting begins.

## Cutting Techniques

### Standard Method (Through Holes)

Threading away from the headstock:

1. **Touch off**: Zero on bore surface
2. **Scratch pass**: Verify pitch without cutting
3. **First cuts**: 0.005" maximum due to tool flex
4. **Reduce incrementally**: 0.002" then 0.001" passes
5. **Spring passes**: Remove tool deflection effects
6. **Test frequently**: Check fit as you approach size

Run slower speeds (100 RPM) initially. Speed increases confidence
but compounds crash severity.

### Reverse Method (Blind Holes)

Threading outward from a relief groove:

1. **Cut relief groove**: At hole bottom using threading tool
2. **Position in groove**: Set carriage zero here
3. **Run lathe in reverse**: Requires secure chuck mounting
4. **Feed outward**: Away from blind end
5. **Return to groove**: Between each pass

This technique eliminates blind hole crash risk while enabling
threads nearly to hole bottom.

## Thread Relief Grooves

Relief grooves serve multiple purposes:

- **Thread runout**: Clean thread termination
- **Tool clearance**: Space for tool withdrawal
- **Assembly relief**: Prevents binding during assembly
- **Chip clearance**: Reduces recutting of chips

Groove dimensions:

- Width: 1.5 × thread pitch minimum
- Depth: To major diameter
- Location: Where full thread depth isn't required

## Measuring Internal Threads

Internal threads resist conventional measurement:

### Direct Methods

- **Thread plug gauges**: Go/no-go for production work
- **Internal micrometers**: Limited to larger threads
- **Three-wire method**: Impractical for internals

### Indirect Methods

- **Machinery's Handbook**: Calculate theoretical depths
- **Test fitting**: Match to mating external thread
- **Depth measurement**: Track tool infeed distance
- **Cast and measure**: Create external replica

Most shops rely on test fitting against known good external threads.

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Torn or Rough Threads

**Causes**: Dull tool, wrong speed, excessive feed
**Solutions**: Sharpen tool, reduce speed, lighter passes

### Oversized Threads

**Causes**: Tool deflection, measurement error
**Solutions**: Increase rigidity, verify setup, spring passes

### Tapered Threads

**Causes**: Tool deflection, bore taper, worn machine
**Solutions**: Reduce cutting forces, check bore first

### Crashed Tools

**Causes**: Miscounted passes, wrong direction, setup error
**Solutions**: Develop consistent habits, use carriage stops

## Alternative Methods

Sometimes single-point threading isn't optimal:

- **Taps**: Faster for standard threads in through holes
- **Thread mills**: CNC option for precise control
- **Helical interpolation**: CNC circular threading
- **Thread inserts**: When material won't hold threads

Choose alternatives based on:

- Production volume
- Thread specifications
- Available equipment
- Operator skill level

## Mastering the Invisible

Internal threading rewards patience and systematic approach. While
external threads offer visual feedback, internal work demands trust
in your setup and faith in your technique. Start with easy materials
and through holes. Build confidence gradually.

Key principles for success:

- Rigidity above all else
- Light cuts preserve control
- Slow speeds reduce anxiety
- Spring passes ensure size
- Test fitting confirms success

The satisfaction of a perfectly fitting internal thread justifies
the initial anxiety. Master this skill and unlock capabilities
beyond any tap's reach.
